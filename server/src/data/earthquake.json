    "description": "An earthquake is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that creates seismic waves.",

    "safetyTips": [
        "Drop to the ground, take cover, and hold on to something sturdy, such as a table or desk.",
        "Stay away from windows, glass, and exterior walls to avoid flying debris.",
        "If you are in bed, stay there, and protect your head with a pillow.",
        "If you are outdoors, move to an open area away from buildings, streetlights, and utility wires.",
        "If you are driving, pull over to a safe location, away from overpasses, bridges, and buildings. Stay inside the vehicle until the shaking stops.",
        "After the shaking stops, be prepared for aftershocks. Check yourself and others for injuries, and administer first aid if necessary.",
        "If you are trapped, use a whistle, your cell phone, or tap on a hard surface to alert rescuers to your location.",
